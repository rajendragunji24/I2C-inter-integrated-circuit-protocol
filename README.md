# I2C-inter-integrated-circuit-protocol
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a synchronous, serial communication protocol using two wires: SDA (data) and SCL (clock). It supports multiple masters and slaves on the same bus. Data transfer uses start/stop conditions, 7/10-bit addressing, ACK/NACK, and clock stretching.
